            High school students have moved on from getting career role models from actual workplaces. Instead, they
            have visual media to give them inspiration for occupational life after high school.

            Due to an increase in media consumption and the COVID-19 pandemic that struck in March 2020, high school
            students have leaned on <strong>social media</strong> to gain knowledge on careers and interests. <br>
            Medical television shows like “Grey’s Anatomy” and “The Good Doctor” are popular among students interested
            in medicine. “Criminal Minds” is loved by students interested in psychology. Media and pop culture have
            provided an entryway for students who may not have had the ability to experience what it is like to work in
            a desired field.

            University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana head psychology academic adviser Gary Wszalek attends to
            students’ interests in careers during their time at U of . <br>

            <b>“Popular TV shows have long influenced students even before <strong>social media</strong>, and we’ve seen admissions
                numbers
                fluctuate as a result,” Wszalek said in an email. “I remember hearing from our pre-law advisors talking
                about how the ‘L.A. Law’ show of the late ‘80s, and early ‘90s had a huge impact on law school
                applications.
                More recently, ‘ER’ and ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ have been a reason for students interested in medical
                school.”</b> <br>

            For many, the discovery of a certain genre of pop culture fueled a desire to work towards a career goal.
            Senior Elk Grove medical students Aileen Saucedo and Damaris Carbajal both consume medical television
            programs that, in their words, inspired them to pursue a career in medicine.

            Both seniors are involved in the CNA medicine path at EGHS. Carbajal said that “Grey’s Anatomy” prepared her
            for what clinicals would be like after months at home due to online learning. <br>

            Senior Elk Grove medical students Aileen Saucedo and Damaris Carbajal both consume medical television
            programs that, in their words, inspired them to pursue a career in medicine.

            Both seniors are involved in the CNA medicine path at EGHS. Carbajal said that “Grey’s Anatomy” prepared her
            for what clinicals would be like after months at home due to online learning.

            “In the show, before they walk in the room they would knock on the door and introduce themselves,” Carbajal
            said. “When we went to clinicals, they made sure to tell us when you walk in their room to make sure you
            knock on the door and introduce yourself.”

            Current TV shows like “Grey’s Anatomy,” for example, combat real-world scenarios like the COVID-19 Pandemic.
            Carbajal and Saucedo both agreed that “Grey’s” properly showed how doctors and surgeons prepare for surgery
            during Covid. PPE was worn on-screen, as characters are seen wearing masks and gloves, and there is a
            constant use of sanitizer and consistent hand-washing.

            Alongside watching “Grey’s Anatomy,” Saucedo utilized <strong>social media</strong> to further extend her passion for
            medicine.

            “There are doctors on YouTube that demonstrate their day-to-day life,” Saucedo said. “Seeing doctors and
            dieticians record their whole day and show how they do this or that they’ll be at this hospital, things like
            that give you such a good insight.”

            YouTube channels like Doctor Mike and The Nurse Nook allow for students like Saucedo to find what kind of
            profession they can envision themselves in and how to work toward it. The Nurse Nook, for example, posts
            videos of Q&A sessions on what it is like to be a night nurse. This type of channel provides students a
            different perspective other than that of a staged show.

            Psychology is also popular at Elk Grove, where just like Carbajal and Saucedo, seniors Pati Bielecka and
            Bridgit Stricker are influenced by CBS’ “Criminal Minds” for their interests in psychology.

            Set in Washington, D.C., “Criminal Minds” tells the story of the behavior analysis unit of the FBI. At 15
            seasons long, “Criminal Minds” is the “Grey’s Anatomy” for psychology enthusiasts.
